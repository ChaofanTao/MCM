# MCM
__Projects__ and __papers__ for the competition [MCM: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/) holden by [COMAP](https://www.comap.com/about/who-we-are.html) and the competition MCM holden by University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

## Brief introduction about COMAP and MCM
> COMAP, the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, is an award-winning non-profit organization whose mission is to improve mathematics education for students of all ages. Since 1980, COMAP has worked with teachers, students, and business people to create  learning environments where mathematics is used to investigate and model real issues in our world.

In the competition of the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), each team is supposed to choose any one of the six problems below and should submit a solution only. 
* Problem A (continuous)
* Problem B (discrete)
* Problem C (data insights)
* Problem D (operations research/network science)
* Problem E (environmental science)
* Problem F (policy)

All of the team members cooperate with each other to propose a mathematical model to solve the problem, and then write code to implement the model. A paper is needed for describing the whole project.
